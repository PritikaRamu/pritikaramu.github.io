Hi! I'm a first year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) where I'm advised by Prof. Rachel Rudinger. I’m a member of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP)](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) Lab in [UMIACS](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/).

Previously, I worked as a Research Associate at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS, Pilani)](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/).

I'm interested in understanding pragmatics and grounding in collaborative human-AI interaction.
